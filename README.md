This code is part of the three distance metrics analysis of my dissertation. 
The files provided here are for a user to test the code and the outputs of it contains part of the research area and part of the road network of Boulder county.
This example is set to calculate only one Dijkstra's shortest path route, from a potential farm point to the power plant and calculate three distances.
The three distances as they are being shown in the output are planar, surface adjusted and pixel to pixel distances.
